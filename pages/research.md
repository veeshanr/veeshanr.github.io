Research
========

Although primarily trained as an applied micro-economist, my research frequently traverses into the interdisciplinary territory. My core research interests lie in the environmental and developmental issues facing vulnerable populations. Below is a preview of my past and current research:

1. [Rayamajhee V, Joshi A, Economic trade-offs between hydroelectricity production and environmental
externalities: A case for local externality mitigation fund, Renewable Energy (2018)] [1]
2. “Natural disaster damages and their link to coping strategy choices: Field survey findings from post- earthquake Nepal.” (with Alok K. Bohara) [Under Review]
3. “Do voluntary associations reduce hunger? An empirical exploration of the social  capital- food security nexus among food impoverished households in western Nepal.” with Alok K. Bohara [Under Review]
4. “An Iron Triangle ROI Model for Healthcare.” with D. van der Goes, N. Edwardson [Revise& Resubmit in ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research].

Papers nearing completion/Working Papers: 

1. “Ex-ante Perception of Climate Change Impact and the Choice of Mitigation Strategies: Evidence from a field survey in Nepal.”
2. “Natural Disasters, Ex-post Coping mechanisms, and Post-disaster Resilience: Evidence from 2015 earthquakes Nepal.”

Upcoming Papers:

1. “Natural Disaster Shocks, Risk Perception, and Willingness to Pay for Weather-indexed Micro-insurance: a pre-post analysis.”
3. “Social Capital, Trust, and its link to Collective Action in a post-disaster setting.”
4. “Social entrepreneurship and disaster resilience: A case study from post earthquake Nepal.”
