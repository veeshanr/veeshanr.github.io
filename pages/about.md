title: About Me
---

Formally trained as an environmental and development economist, my research ventures into an interdisciplinary territory of the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions. I use econometric methods and optimal control modeling to study a variety of issues pertaining to climate change, natural disasters, environmental externalities, food security, and social capital. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Food Security*, *Renewable Energy*, *Journal of International Development*, and *Clinicoeconnomics and Outcomes Research*. 

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from Bryn Athyn College, Pennsylvania. I also hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics (UNM). I am also an Adam Smith Fellow at the [Mercatus Center] [1] (George Mason University) and a Humane Studies Fellow at the [Institute of Humane Studies] [2].

The Nepalese in me finds solace in mountains and wilderness. I enjoy backpacking in the American Southwest. When ABQ temperature falls below 90, I love hiking in the Sandias, and running around Nobhill.
