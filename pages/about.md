title: About Me
---

I joined [North Dakota State University][4] as an assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics][5] and a faculty fellow at the [Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise][6] in August 2019. My research uses interdisciplinary approaches to understand issues that lie at the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions. I use econometric methods and optimal control modeling to study a variety of issues pertaining to climate change, natural disasters, environmental externalities, food security, and social capital. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Food Security*, *Renewable Energy*, *Journal of International Development*, and *Clinicoeconomics and Outcomes Research*. 

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from [Bryn Athyn College][1], Pennsylvania. I received my Master's and doctorate degrees in economics from the [University of New Mexico][2]. I was an Adam Smith Fellow at the [Mercatus Center] [3] (George Mason University) for AYs 2017/18 and 2018/19.

**Research Interests:**

Economics of Disasters and Climate Change; Social Capital; Food Security, Collective Action; New Institutional Economics
