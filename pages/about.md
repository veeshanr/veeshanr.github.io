title: About Me
---

I am an assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics][5] and a faculty fellow at the [Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise][6] at [North Dakota State University][4]. I am also a faculty scholar at the [Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at NDSU][7]. My research focuses on societal responses to natural hazards, opiod overdose, obesity, and other crises. My current research agenda can be categorized into three areas: 1) the relationship between disasters and societal change, 2) the interation between formal and informal institutions, and 3) social and economic impacts of public policies. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Health Economics*, *Journal of Institutional Economics*, *Review of Development Economics*, *Economics of Disasters and Climate Change*, *Disasters*, *International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction*, *Natural Hazards*, *Journal of International Development*, *Climate and Development*, *Food Security*, and *Renewable Energy*. 

I live in West Fargo, North Dakota with my wife and pet children (two cats and a dog). When the school is not in session, we enjoy hiking, biking, and backpacking in neigboring states (ND is very flat!).

**Current Research Projects:**
Opioid Crises; Disasters; Institutional Change
