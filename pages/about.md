title: About Me
---

Formally trained as an environmental and development economist, my research ventures into an interdisciplinary territory of the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions. I use econometric methods and optimal control modeling to study a variety of issues pertaining to climate change, natural disasters, environmental externalities, food security, and social capital. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Food Security*, *Renewable Energy*, *Journal of International Development*, and *Clinicoeconomics and Outcomes Research*. 

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from [Bryn Athyn College][1], Pennsylvania. I received my Master's and doctorate degrees in economics from the [University of New Mexico][2]. I am also an Adam Smith Fellow at the [Mercatus Center] [3] (George Mason University).

I am happy to announce that I will be joining North Dakota State University as an assistant professor of economics in the Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics and a faculty fellow at the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise starting Fall-2019.
