title: About Me
---

I am an assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Economics, Applied Statistics, & International Business][1] at [New Mexico State University][2].

My fields of interest are Development Economics, Political Economy, Health Economics, and Environmental Economics. My research examines societal responses to natural disasters and other shocks. My current projects focus on three areas: 1) the relationship between natural disasters and social change, 2) economic consequences of political crises, and 3) polycentric governance of externalities. I have published twenty-five papers in peer-reviewed journals such as *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*, *Health Economics*, *Journal of Comparative Economics*, *Public Choice*, *Journal of Institutional Economics*, and *Review of Development Economics*.

I live in Las Cruces, New Mexico with my wife (Stephanie) and son (Boden). When the school is not in session, we enjoy hiking, biking, and backpacking.
