I am an (incoming) assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Economics, Applied Statistics, & International Business][1] at [New Mexico State University][2].

My fields of interest are Development Economics, Political Economy, Health Economics, and Environmental Economics. I have published over twenty papers in peer-reviewed journals such as *Journal of Comparative Economics*, *Health Economics*, *Public Choice*, *Journal of Institutional Economics*, *Review of Development Economics*, *Economics of Disasters and Climate Change*, *Disasters*, *International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction*, and *Marine Policy*. 

I live in Las Cruces, Mexico with my wife, son, and pet children (a cat and a dog). When the school is not in session, we enjoy hiking, biking, and backpacking.
