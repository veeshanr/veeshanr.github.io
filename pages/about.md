![Profile Picture](/img/profile.jpg)

Trained as an applied microeconomist, my research ventures into a somewhat interdisciplinary territory of the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions. 

My dissertation work focuses on understanding the determinants of household resilience against natural disaster shocks. Using self-collected field survey data from post-earthquake Nepal, I conduct pre-post and ex-post analyses of the impacts of the earthquakes on economic and psychosocial wellbeing of individuals. Since earthquakes are largely exogenous events, the devastating 2015 earthquakes in Nepal provided a natural experimental set up for me to study ex-post coping mechanisms that households adopt and the efficacy of specific mechanisms on the long-run resilience. I also use contingent valuation techniques to elicit people's willingness to adopt weather-indexed insurance as a mitigation strategy against potential climate shocks. Juxtaposing my results with that from a previous study in the same region, I conduct a comparative analysis to understand changes in underlying risk averseness as a result of the natural disaster shock.

I have a broad range of interests within economics as well as its interdisciplinary offshoots, and am passionate about conducting problem-driven, policy-oriented research in pressing environmental and development issues in vulnerable communities. My past research have also included topics in health and development economics.

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from Bryn Athyn College, Pennsylvania. I also hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics (UNM). 

I am an Adam Smith Fellow at the Mercatus Center (George Mason University) for the 2017-2018 academic year.
