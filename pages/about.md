title: About Me
---

Formally trained as an environmental and development economist, my research ventures into an interdisciplinary territory of the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions. I use econometric methods and optimal control modeling to study a variety of issues pertaining to climate change, natural disasters, environmental externalities, food security, and social capital. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Food Security*, *Renewable Energy*, *Journal of International Development*, and *Clinicoeconomics and Outcomes Research*. 

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from Bryn Athyn College, Pennsylvania. I am also an Adam Smith Fellow at the [Mercatus Center] [1] (George Mason University).

The Nepalese in me finds solace in mountains and wilderness. I enjoy backpacking in the American Southwest. When ABQ temperature falls below 90, I love hiking in the Sandias, and running around Nobhill. 

I am on the 2018-19 econ job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA/AEA Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA from January 4-6, 2019.
