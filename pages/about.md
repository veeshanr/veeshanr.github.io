![Profile Picture](/img/profile.png)

Trained as an applied microeconomist, my research ventures into a somewhat interdisciplinary territory of the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions.

My dissertation focuses on the determinants of household resilience against natural disaster shocks. Using survey data that I collected from post-earthquake Nepal, I empirically examine the interlink between the households' ex-post coping responses and their economic and psychosocial resilience. A chapter of my dissertation is devoted to understanding the role of social capital in fostering collective action for post-disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. My study also uses contingent valuation techniques to elicit people's willingness to adopt weather-indexed insurance as a mitigation strategy against potential climate shocks. Juxtaposing my results with that from a previous survey study using a full-information likelihood (FIMLE) set up, I scrutinize changes in preferences and underlying risk averseness as a result of the natural disaster shock.

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from Bryn Athyn College, Pennsylvania. I also hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics (UNM).

I am an Adam Smith Fellow at the Mercatus Center (George Mason University) for the 2017-2018 academic year.
