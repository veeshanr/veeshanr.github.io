title: About Me
---

I am an assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics][5] and a faculty fellow at the [Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise][6] at [North Dakota State University][4]. I am also a faculty scholar at the [Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at NDSU][7]. My current research focuses on societal responses to natural hazards, obesity, opiod overdose, and other crises. My research agenda can be categorized into three focus areas: 1) the relationship between disasters and societal change, 2) the interation between formal and informal institutions, and 3) impact of policy changes on social and economic outcomes. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Health Economics*, *Journal of Institutional Economics*, *Review of Development Economics*, *Economics of Disasters and Climate Change*, *Disasters*, *Natural Hazards*, *Journal of International Development*, *Climate and Development*, *Food Security*, and *Renewable Energy*. 

I live in West Fargo, North Dakota with my wife and pet children (two cats and a dog). When the school is not in session, we enjoy hiking, biking, and backpacking in neigboring states (ND is very flat!).
