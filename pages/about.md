title: About Me
---

I am an assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics][5] and a faculty fellow at the [Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise][6] at [North Dakota State University][4]. My research uses interdisciplinary approaches to understand issues that lie at the intersection between natural and human systems. I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks. I use a range of empirical tools to study issues related to climate change, natural disasters, environmental externalities, and food security, among others. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Journal of Institutional Economics*, *Economics of Disasters and Climate Change*, *Journal of International Development*, *Food Security*, and *Renewable Energy*. 

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from [Bryn Athyn College][1], Pennsylvania. I received my Master's and doctorate degrees in economics from the [University of New Mexico][2]. I was an Adam Smith Fellow at the [Mercatus Center] [3] (George Mason University) for AYs 2017/18 and 2018/19.

**Research Interests:**
