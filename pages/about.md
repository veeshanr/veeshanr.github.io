title: About Me
---

I am an assistant professor of economics in the [Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics][5] and a faculty fellow at the [Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise][6] at [North Dakota State University][4]. I am also a faculty scholar at the [Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at NDSU][7], . I study societal responses to natural hazards and other covariate shocks. My current research agenda focuses on two areas: 1) the relationship between disasters and societal change, and 2) the interation between formal and informal institutions. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Journal of Institutional Economics*, *Economics of Disasters and Climate Change*, *Disasters*, *Natural Hazards*, *Journal of International Development*, *Climate and Development*, *Food Security*, and *Renewable Energy*. 

Originally from Nepal, I received my Bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Mathematics and Business management) and an Associate's degree in Philosophy, both from [Bryn Athyn College][1], Pennsylvania. I received my Master's and doctorate degrees in economics from the [University of New Mexico][2].
