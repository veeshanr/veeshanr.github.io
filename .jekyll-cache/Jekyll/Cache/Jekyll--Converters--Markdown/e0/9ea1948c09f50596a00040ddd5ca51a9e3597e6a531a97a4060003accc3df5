I"’<p>I am an assistant professor of economics in the <a href="https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/agecon">Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics</a> and a faculty fellow at the <a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/centers/pcpe/">Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise</a> at <a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/">North Dakota State University</a>.

I am particularly interested in human responses to natural shocks in vulnerable communities and regions. I use a range of empirical tools to study issues related to climate change, natural disasters, environmental externalities, and food security, among others. My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as <em>Food Security</em>, <em>Renewable Energy</em>, <em>Journal of International Development</em>, and <em>Clinicoeconomics and Outcomes Research</em>.</p>
