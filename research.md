==================

Although primarily trained as an applied micro-economist, my research frequently traverses into the interdisciplinary territory. My core research interests lie in the environmental and developmental issues facing vulnerable populations. Below is a preview of my past and current research:

	1. “Do voluntary associations reduce hunger? An empirical exploration of the social capital- food security nexus among food impoverished households in western Nepal.” with Alok K. Bohara [Under Review]
	2. “An Iron Triangle ROI Model for Healthcare.” with D. van der Goes, N. Edwardson [Revise& Resubmit in ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research] .
	3. “How should hydropower plants pay for negative externalities? An economic analysis of the trade-offs between energy production and crop loss using externality mitigation fund approach.” with Aakrit Joshi [Under Review]
	
Papers nearing completion/Working Papers: 

	1. “Ex-ante Perception of Climate Change Impact and the Choice of Mitigation Strategies: Evidence from a field survey in Nepal.”
	2. “Natural Disasters, Ex-post Coping mechanisms, and Post-disaster Resilience: Evidence from 2015 earthquakes Nepal.”

Upcoming Papers:

	1. “Natural Disaster Shocks, Risk Perception, and Willingness to Pay for Weather-indexed Micro-insurance: a pre-post analysis.”
	3. “Social Capital and its link to Collective Action in a post-disaster setting.”
	4. “Social entrepreneurship and disaster resilience: A case study from post-earthquake Nepal.”
